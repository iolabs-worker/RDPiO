//! Process-global allocation accounting, over mimalloc.
//!
//! Two jobs in one type:
//!
//! 1. **The allocator itself is mimalloc**, not the platform default. On Windows
//!    `System` is `HeapAlloc`, whose per-heap lock is contended by our three hot
//!    threads (network receive, decode, UI/present) — and the tile codecs
//!    (ClearCodec, progressive, planar) allocate a buffer per tile, hundreds per
//!    frame. mimalloc's per-thread free lists serve those from thread-local
//!    storage with no cross-thread lock, which is exactly this workload's shape.
//!
//! 2. **Accounting**, so the telemetry line can report allocator pressure across
//!    the whole process: how many allocations happened in a reporting window and
//!    how many bytes they asked for. Two relaxed atomic adds per allocation; the
//!    per-window Metrics report drains them.
//!
//!    Both counters are add-only. Tracking *live* bytes instead — adding on
//!    alloc, subtracting on free — underflows as soon as a window boundary falls
//!    between an allocation and its matching free, since `drain` resets the
//!    counter to zero and the later free then subtracts from it. That printed
//!    `allocs=1872/18446744073709MB` in the metrics line. Counting only what was
//!    requested is both the more useful number and one that cannot wrap.
