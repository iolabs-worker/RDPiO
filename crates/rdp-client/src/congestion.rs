//! Network-congestion estimation for the UDP side-band transport.
//!
//! On a clean wired LAN the multitransport's UDP path is a pure win and needs no
//! tuning. On a *lossy* link — a host on Wi-Fi, say — two things have to adapt:
//!
//!  * **The retransmit timeout (RTO).** A fixed 200 ms is absurd when the RTT is
//!    5 ms: a lost reliable datagram then stalls ~40× longer than it should.
//!    [`RttEstimator`] tracks SRTT/RTTVAR (Jacobson/Karels, RFC 6298) and yields
//!    a sane, responsive RTO.
//!
//!  * **The server's send rate.** The only client-side lever RDP gives us is the
//!    RDPGFX frame-ack `queueDepth` — the server paces itself to it. Normally we
//!    report just the decode backlog, but a fast client GPU decodes
//!    instantly, so on a dropping Wi-Fi link the backlog reads ~0 and the server
//!    never slows down even as packets are lost. [`Congestion`] turns observed
//!    loss + RTT inflation into an *additional* `queueDepth` bias so the server
//!    eases off before the link is overrun, then releases it as the link
//!    recovers.
//!
//! Pure and clock-free (it works in [`Duration`]s the caller measures), so it is
//! unit-tested without a network.
