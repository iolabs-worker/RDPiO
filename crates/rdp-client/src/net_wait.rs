//! Event-driven waiting for the session worker (Windows).
//!
//! The graphics-session worker multiplexes one thread across the TLS socket,
//! input forwarding, clipboard, resize and device chores. It used to pace all
//! of that with a 1 ms `SO_RCVTIMEO` poll — 60–1000 wakeups per second for the
//! life of the session, idle or not, which kept the CPU package out of its deep
//! C-states and showed up directly as battery drain (mstsc is event-driven
//! here). [`SocketWait`] replaces the poll: the socket is switched to event
//! notification (`WSAEventSelect`, which also makes it non-blocking) and the
//! worker blocks on *socket readable/closed* OR *another thread queued work*
//! (the [`worker_wake`] event, signalled by the input/clipboard/resize/touch/
//! stop producers) OR a timeout for time-based chores. Idle cost drops to ~2
//! wakeups a second while input still ships the instant it is queued.
//!
//! Consequence of the non-blocking mode: reads surface `WouldBlock` instead of
//! blocking (the TLS layer and `poll_tpkt_pdu` already resume cleanly across
//! that), and writes can too — the TLS write path rides those out internally so
//! a record is never truncated.
