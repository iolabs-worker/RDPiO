//! TURN redirect resolver for the native Teams engine (`--teams-native`).
//!
//! webrtc-rs 0.17's ICE agent can't follow a TURN `300 Try Alternate` redirect,
//! and Teams' relays are fronted by an Azure **anycast** address that answers the
//! first Allocate with exactly that — so webrtc-rs allocates no relay candidate
//! and every ICE check fails. rdpio already speaks TURN (for W365 Shortpath), so
//! this reuses [`crate::stun::TurnClient`] to follow the redirect (an
//! unauthenticated probe — the 300 comes before any auth) and report the unicast
//! backend. [`rdp_webrtc`]'s engine then rewrites the `turn:` URL to that backend,
//! which webrtc-rs can allocate with the ordinary (redirect-free) flow.
