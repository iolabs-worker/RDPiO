//! GPU backend: Direct3D 11/12 device + swapchain, hardware H.264 decode, and
//! surface compositing/present.
//!
//! The [`Renderer`] enum wraps either the Direct3D 11 or Direct3D 12 backend and
//! exposes a single uniform API. D3D11 is the default; D3D12 is selectable via
//! [`Backend::D3D12`] and adds a compute-shader NV12→RGB conversion path plus a
//! lower-overhead present queue with tearing/VRR support. [`h264`] provides DXVA
//! GPU decode (zero-copy) for the D3D11 backend, a software decode fallback, and
//! an H.264 encoder.
//!
//! The renderer is Windows-only. A stub keeps the workspace loading on other
//! hosts so the sans-I/O crates stay testable everywhere.
