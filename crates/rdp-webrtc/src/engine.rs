//! webrtc-rs-backed WebRTC engine (feature `engine`).
//!
//! Phase B: turn the reversed webrtc.1 object-model calls into *real* WebRTC via
//! [`webrtc`] (webrtc-rs). Given the `createPeerConnection` / `addTransceiver` /
//! `setDirection` / `createOffer` / `setLocal`+`setRemoteDescription` calls a
//! session issues, this drives a live [`RTCPeerConnection`] and produces the SDP
//! offer, gathers ICE, and accepts the peer's answer — the same operations the
//! Windows add-in performs, but portable. Validated against a real captured Teams
//! call (see `tests/engine_replay.rs`).
//!
//! The engine is intentionally a thin, imperative surface (one method per RPC).
//! The [`crate::session`] dispatcher will call these and marshal the results/
//! events back onto the channel; keeping the engine free of protocol-framing
//! concerns makes it independently testable.
